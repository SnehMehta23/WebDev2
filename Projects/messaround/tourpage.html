        Experience the best of India's famous Golden Triangle Tour which
        compromises Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur. Amber Fort is also known as Amer
        Fort which is one of the most visited tourist attractions of Rajasthan
        as well as one of the renowned Historical Place of India. You will be
        amazed by the awesome route and architecture of Amer Fort. Made from
        sandstone and marble, this amazing fort comprises a series of four
        courtyards, halls, palaces, and gardens. At its entrance lies the
        primary courtyard, known as Jaleb Chowk, where the king's soldiers
        assembled and paraded themselves around. Suraj Pol (Sun Gate) and Chand
        Pol (Moon Gate) lead into this courtyard. To the right, its Shila Devi
        temple which remains open from 6 a.m. until 10:30 a.m., and again from 4
        p.m. until 8 p.m. Sacrifices were part of the temple rituals, as the
        goddess is an incarnation of Kali. Legend has it that human heads were
        originally offered to the goddess before she was persuaded to accept
        goats.
